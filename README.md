## Developer Notes

üëÄ This project is not yet ready for production use. But, please, have a try!

You can try by using a release, or:

1. Install [Werkzeug](https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/#files) by either using `pip` or placing the folder `Werkzeug-(version)/src/werkzeug` from downloaded archive to cloned repo.

2. Install [WSGIserver](https://pypi.org/project/WSGIserver/#files) by either using `pip` or placing the file `WSGIserver-(version)/wsgiserver.py` from downloaded archive to cloned repo.

3. Pick a HFS template (for HFS 2.4), rename it to `hfs.tpl` and place into cloned repo.

4. Configure port, base folder and upload-allowed folders in `hfs.ini`.

5. For running a server, open `run.py`; for developing, open `test.py`.

Template choices:

- [HFS Default Template](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs2/raw/master/default.tpl)
- [Takeback](https://github.com/NaitLee/Takeback-HFS-Template/releases/latest) (Recommended)
- [Throwback](http://rejetto.com/forum/index.php?topic=12055.0)
- [Stripes](http://rejetto.com/forum/index.php?topic=13415.0)
- [mobil-light](http://rejetto.com/forum/index.php?topic=11754.msg1066583#msg1066583)

### Notes

- To use in QPython 3L on Android:
  - Put repo into folder `/sdcard/qpython/projects3`, ensure folder is not nested.
  - Rename `run.py` to `main.py`.
  - In QPython 3L app, go to Programs, in Projects tab, select repo name then run.

### Files

- `test.py`: Run a server for testing, debugging. It also contains werkzeug's reload feature.
- `run.py`: Run a simple server. Has no debug feature, but works on [pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) on aarch64 architecture.
- `hfs.ini`: Some configs, like port, are here. Currently you can set a base path as the root dir of served pages, also can set upload-allowed paths.

- `_test_macro.py`: Run & test a macro, by entering as argv1 in commandline.

- `cfgLib.py`: The `Config` object is inside this file.
- `classesLib.py`: Some useful `class`es are here.
- `helpersLib.py`: Some useful functions are here.
- `mimeLib.py`: Manages MIME types. Get a defined MIME type with something like `mimeLib.getmime('*.html')`. You can define your own MIMEs in `mime.ini`.
- `scriptLib.py`: When executing a macro/symbol, usually functions in this file will be called.
- `serverLib.py`: Defines a WSGI application, which acts like original HFS.
- `tplLib.py`: The template is interpreted by this.
