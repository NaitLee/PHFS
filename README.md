# PHFS
üí´ *This is a Python3 implementation of rejetto's [HTTP File Server](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs2)~*

----
üèó Under construction...

üéâ Please help make this project grow. **All contributions are welcome!**

----

üëè Features that work:

- Filelist, download
- Sorting files, Archiving
- Some macros, `special:alias`
- Upload
- Search
- Translations, `special:strings`

üï≥ Features that don't work:

- Virtual File System
- File actions
- Accounts, Login, Ban, Limits, ...

üçâ Supported platforms:

- All x86, x64 platforms that Python 3.7 supports:
  - Windows 7 and upper
  - GNU/Linux, *nix, *BSD
  - ...

- Some ARM platforms:
  - Android, with [QPython 3L](https://www.qpython.org/)
  - ARM Boards like Raspberry Pi, with [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/)
  - ...

- Maybe more!

## Developer Notes

üëÄ This project is only half working, it is not yet ready for production use. Testing only.

If you are interested in testing this project, please do the following:

1. Install [Werkzeug](https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/) by either using `pip` or placing the folder `Werkzeug-(version)/src/werkzeug` from downloaded archive to cloned repo.

2. Pick a HFS template (for HFS 2.4), rename it to `hfs.tpl` and place into cloned repo.

3. Configure port, base folder and upload-allowed folders in `hfs.ini`.

4. For running a server, open `_run_simple.py`; for developing, open `_test.py`; for using as a CGI server with Apache etc., use `cgi.cgi`, and consult Internet for how-to.

Template choices:

- [HFS Default Template](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs2/raw/master/default.tpl)
- [Takeback](https://github.com/NaitLee/Takeback-HFS-Template/releases/latest)
- [Throwback](http://rejetto.com/forum/index.php?topic=12055.0)
- [Stripes](http://rejetto.com/forum/index.php?topic=13415.0)

### Notes

- To use in QPython 3L on Android:
  - Put repo into folder `/sdcard/qpython/projects3`, ensure folder is not nested.
  - Rename `_run_simple.py` to `main.py`.
  - In QPython 3L app, go to Programs, in Projects tab, select repo name then run.

### Files

- `_test.py`: Run a server for testing, debugging. It also contains werkzeug's reload feature.
- `_run_simple.py`: Run a simple server. Has no debug feature, but works on [pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) on aarch64 architecture.
- `hfs.ini`: Some configs, like port, are here. Currently you can set a base path as the root dir of served pages, also can set upload-allowed paths.

- `_test_macro.py`: Run & test a macro, by entering as argv1 in commandline.
- `cgi.cgi`: For being used as a CGI application with Apache, Nginx etc.

- `cfgLib.py`: The `Config` object is inside this file.
- `classesLib.py`: Some useful `class`es are here.
- `helpersLib.py`: Some useful functions are here.
- `mimeLib.py`: Manages MIME types. Get a defined MIME type with something like `mimeLib.getmime('*.html')`. You can define your own MIMEs in `mime.ini`.
- `scriptLib.py`: When executing a macro/symbol, usually functions in this file will be called.
- `serverLib.py`: Defines a WSGI application, which acts like original HFS.
- `tplLib.py`: The template is interpreted by this.
